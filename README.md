## Features

- **High Performance**: Designed for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for production environments.
- **Extensible**: Modular components allow for easy enhancements and customization.
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic intelligently to improve response times and resource utilization.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures reliability through effective error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- **Concurrency**: Utilizes Go's goroutines for handling multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Health Checks**: Monitors the health of backend services to maintain uptime.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls traffic to protect resources and ensure fair usage.
- **Observability**: Integrates logging and metrics for monitoring and debugging.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Proxy server, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/tbsphathuynh/proxy/releases). You will find the binaries available for various platforms. After downloading, execute the binary to start using the server.

### Prerequisites

- Go version 1.16 or higher.
- Basic knowledge of Go and networking concepts.
- A terminal or command line interface.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tbsphathuynh/proxy.git
   cd proxy
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   go build -o proxy-server
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   ./proxy-server
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can configure it by editing the configuration file or passing parameters through the command line. Here’s a simple example of how to run the proxy with a basic configuration.

```bash
./proxy-server -config config.yaml
```

### Configuration File

The configuration file allows you to set various parameters such as:

- Backend servers
- Load balancing strategy
- Rate limiting settings
- Health check intervals

An example configuration file looks like this:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: http://backend1.example.com
  - url: http://backend2.example.com

load_balancing:
  strategy: round_robin

health_checks:
  interval: 10s
```

## Architecture

The Proxy server is built on a clean architecture that separates concerns and enhances maintainability. Key architectural patterns include:

- **Microservices**: Each component of the proxy can be treated as a microservice, allowing for independent development and scaling.
- **Interfaces**: Core components interact through interfaces, enabling easy swapping and testing of implementations.
- **Concurrency Primitives**: Utilizes Go’s goroutines and channels to manage concurrent operations effectively.

## Components

### Load Balancer

The load balancer is responsible for distributing incoming requests across multiple backend servers. It supports various strategies, including:

- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests evenly.
- **Least Connections**: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hashing**: Routes requests based on the client’s IP address.

### Health Checker

The health checker monitors the status of backend services. It periodically sends requests to check if the services are operational. If a service fails, it is temporarily removed from the load balancing pool.

### Rate Limiter

The rate limiter controls the number of requests a client can make in a given timeframe. This helps prevent abuse and ensures fair resource distribution.

### Observability Tools

The Proxy server includes logging and metrics collection features. You can integrate with tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
